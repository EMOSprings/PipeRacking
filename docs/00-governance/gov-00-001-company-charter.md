# Company Charter

## 1. Our Mission

To sell high-quality, customisable modular racking through a simple and clear online design tool.

## 2. Our Goal

To be the best online store for modular pipe racking in the UK, known for good products, happy customers, and smart improvements.

## 3. How We Work

We use Lean principles to give customers what they want without the waste. This means:

*   **Focus on the Customer:** We build our business around what our customers need. The 3D design tool and clear pricing are just the start.
*   **Just-in-Time (JIT) Stock:** We keep costs low by ordering parts from our suppliers only when a customer places an order. This reduces waste and storage needs. As we grow, we will use sales data to decide which popular parts to begin stocking for faster delivery.
*   **Always Improving (Kaizen):** We are always looking for ways to make our products, processes, and services better. Everyone is encouraged to suggest improvements.
*   **Make Smart Decisions:** We use real data from sales, operations, and customer feedback to make choices. This keeps us sharp and effective.

## 4. What We Aim For

*   **Commercial:**
    *   Launch the website with the 3D design tool within one year.
    *   Become a known name for racking among UK hobbyists and small businesses.
*   **Financial:**
    *   Be profitable by the end of year two.
    *   Follow all UK financial rules.
*   **Operational:**
    *   Keep over 95% of our customers happy.
    *   Create a simple and fast process from ordering to sending.

## 5. Our Commitment to Quality

Quality is essential. We will use a Quality Management System (QMS) based on **ISO 9001:2015** to make sure we hit our goals and keep our customers happy.

This QMS won't just be a set of rules; it will be how we work. It's the practical way we'll deliver on the promises in this charter.
