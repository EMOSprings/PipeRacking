# Quality Policy

This business is committed to providing high-quality products and services that meet our customers' needs. This policy outlines the core principles of our Quality Management System (QMS), as first stated in our Company Charter (GOV-00-001).

Our commitment is to:

1.  **Understand and Meet Customer Needs:** We will listen to our customers and deliver products that are fit for purpose, on time, and to the standard we have promised.

2.  **Deliver High-Quality Products:** We will use good materials and clear processes to build reliable and effective modular racking solutions.

3.  **Continually Improve:** We will use our Lean principles and data from our operations to constantly find better ways of working, reduce waste, and improve our products.

4.  **Involve Everyone:** We believe quality is the responsibility of the entire team. We encourage all staff to identify problems and suggest improvements.

5.  **Comply with Requirements:** We are committed to meeting our obligations under the ISO 9001:2015 standard and all relevant UK laws and regulations.

This policy provides the framework for our quality objectives and is the foundation of our commitment to our customers and our own high standards.
