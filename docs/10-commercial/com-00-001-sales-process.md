# Sales Process

This procedure outlines the steps for processing a customer order from the initial online configuration to the final confirmation.

## 1. Customer Configuration

The sales process begins when a customer uses the online 3D Configurator to design and submit an order.

## 2. Order Review

Upon submission, the order details are automatically entered into the system. A designated staff member will review the order for any potential issues or special requests.

## 3. Customer Confirmation

An automated email is sent to the customer confirming the order details, total cost, and estimated delivery date.

## 4. Handover to Operations

Once confirmed, the order is passed to the Operations team for fulfilment, as detailed in **OPS-00-001 - Order Fulfilment**.
