# Invoicing Process

This procedure outlines the steps for generating and managing customer invoices.

## 1. Invoice Generation

When a customer completes an order through the online configurator, an invoice is automatically generated in our accounting system (e.g., Xero, QuickBooks).

## 2. Payment Processing

Payment is captured at the time of order via our integrated payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

## 3. Reconciliation

At the end of each business day, the Finance team reconciles the payments received with the invoices generated to ensure all accounts are balanced.

## 4. Refunds

In the event of a return or order cancellation, a credit note is issued and the refund is processed through the original payment gateway.
