# Roles and Responsibilities for Quality

To meet our commitment to quality as stated in our Quality Policy (GOV-00-002), it is essential that everyone understands their role. This document outlines the key responsibilities for quality within the business.

## 1. Top Management (The Business Owner)

As the leader of the business, Top Management has the ultimate responsibility for the success of the Quality Management System (QMS). This includes:

*   **Leading by Example:** Demonstrating a clear and consistent commitment to quality.
*   **Setting Policy:** Establishing and upholding the Company Charter and Quality Policy.
*   **Providing Resources:** Ensuring there is enough time, equipment, and training to meet our quality standards.
*   **Reviewing Performance:** Regularly reviewing the performance of the QMS to ensure it is effective and supports our business goals.
*   **Promoting Improvement:** Encouraging a culture of continuous improvement across the business.

## 2. QMS Representative

A designated QMS Representative (initially the Business Owner) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the QMS. Their duties are to:

*   **Oversee the System:** Ensure that all QMS processes are established, implemented, and maintained correctly.
*   **Report on Performance:** Report to Top Management on how the QMS is performing and identify any needs for improvement.
*   **Promote Customer Focus:** Ensure that the entire business is aware of customer requirements.
*   **Manage Documentation:** Control and manage all documents within the QMS, ensuring they are up-to-date and accessible.

## 3. All Staff

Every person working for the business has a direct impact on quality. Therefore, all staff are responsible for:

*   **Following Procedures:** Adhering to the established processes and instructions documented within our Digital OS.
*   **Identifying Problems:** Reporting any issues with products, processes, or the QMS to the QMS Representative.
*   **Suggesting Improvements:** Actively participating in our culture of continuous improvement by suggesting better ways of working.
*   **Understanding the Policy:** Being aware of the Quality Policy and how their work contributes to it.
