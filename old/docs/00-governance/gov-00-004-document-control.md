# Document Control Procedure

## 1. Purpose

This procedure defines the controls for creating, reviewing, approving, distributing, and updating all documents within the Quality Management System (QMS) to ensure that personnel have access to the latest approved information and that obsolete documents are prevented from unintended use.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all quality-related documents, including policies, procedures, work instructions, forms, and external documents of interest.

## 3. Responsibilities

*   **Document Owner:** Responsible for creating, reviewing, and updating the document.
*   **Approver:** Responsible for approving the document for release.
*   **All Staff:** Responsible for using the correct versions of documents.

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1. Document Creation

Documents are created using the standard templates and stored in the appropriate folder within the `docs/` directory. Each document must have a unique ID and frontmatter as defined in the `project_context.md`.

### 4.2. Review and Approval

Once a draft is complete, the owner will submit it for approval. Approval is managed via the designated digital workflow (e.g., GitHub Pull Requests).

### 4.3. Distribution and Access

All approved documents are published to the company's Digital OS website, which serves as the single source of truth. All staff have access to the documents relevant to their roles.

### 4.4. Document Changes

Changes to a document follow the same review and approval process as new documents. The version history will be maintained by the version control system (Git).

### 4.5. Obsolete Documents

Obsolete documents are automatically archived by the version control system and are removed from the live website to prevent unintended use.
