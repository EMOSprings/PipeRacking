# Corrective Action Procedure

## 1. Purpose

To establish a systematic process for identifying, documenting, investigating, and implementing corrective actions to eliminate the root causes of non-conformities and prevent their recurrence.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all non-conformities identified within the QMS, including product defects, process failures, customer complaints, and audit findings.

## 3. Responsibilities

*   **All Staff:** Responsible for identifying and reporting non-conformities.
*   **Assigned Investigator:** Responsible for investigating the root cause and proposing a corrective action plan.
*   **Approver:** Responsible for approving the corrective action plan and verifying its effectiveness.

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1. Identification of Non-Conformity

Any employee can identify a non-conformity. It must be reported immediately using the designated Corrective Action Request (CAR) form.

### 4.2. Root Cause Analysis

The assigned investigator will use appropriate tools (e.g., 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram) to determine the root cause of the non-conformity.

### 4.3. Corrective Action Plan

Based on the root cause, a plan will be developed outlining the actions to be taken, the responsible person(s), and the deadline. The plan must be approved before implementation.

### 4.4. Implementation and Verification

The corrective actions are implemented, and the effectiveness of the actions is verified to ensure the non-conformity does not recur. The results are documented in the CAR.

### 4.5. Closure

Once the corrective action is verified as effective, the CAR is formally closed.
