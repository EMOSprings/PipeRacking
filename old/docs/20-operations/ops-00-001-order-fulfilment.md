# Order Fulfilment

This procedure describes the process for fulfilling a customer order after it has been confirmed by the Commercial team.

## 1. Receive Order

The Operations team receives the confirmed order details from the sales system.

## 2. Pick and Pack

Components for the order are picked from the warehouse inventory. The items are then securely packed for shipping, along with assembly instructions.

## 3. Dispatch

The packed order is dispatched via our designated courier service. The tracking information is automatically sent to the customer.

## 4. Stock Management

Inventory levels are automatically updated in the system. If stock for any component falls below a predefined threshold, a reorder alert is triggered.
